# :movie_camera: MediaButler
MediaButler is here to give you the overview of your media libraries. It leverages MediaInfo to get the most info out of your media.

## :dart: Purpose
You have thousands of media files laying around and lost the overview of what is what? MediaButler aims to solve this.

It uses MediaInfo to parse your files and get info like:
* Resolution
* Bitrate
* Bit depth
* Aspect ratio
* Audio channels
* Audio codecs
* ... and many more

You can filter your media library based on any value and get a detailed list on what's your media made of.
